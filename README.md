## PROV4WFs
Prov4WFs is a service to track the provenance of a workflow run via a Workflow Management System (WMS) at run time. It is compliant with the W3C PROV standard.

It allows scientists or users in general to manage the provenance information collected during the execution. It focuses on a whole workflow and on specific steps inside it.

Prov4WFs is a [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it) project, that extends the [yProv service](https://github.com/HPCI-Lab/yProv) moving the attention on the workflow level. It is designed as a plug-in usable by various WMS.

Currently, Prov4WFs is developed to be run on the following Workflow Management Systems:
-  Streamflow (https://github.com/HPCI-Lab/prov4wfs/blob/main/HowToRun_Prov4WFs_Streamflow.md)
