## PROV4WFS
prov4wfs is a provenance service aimed at obtaining at run time the provenance of a workflow runned via Workflow Management System (WMS). It allows scientists to manage provenance information compliant with the W3C PROV standard, focused on the workflow in general and on the different steps composing a workflow.

prov4wfs is a [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it) project, that extends [yProv service](https://github.com/HPCI-Lab/yProv) in the provenance tracking at the workflow level, designed as a plug-in usable by various WMS.
